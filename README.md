# pytorch-ai-chatbot
Chatbot built using PyTorch, relying on custom intents and responses.

This project was created to play around with PyTorch to gain familiarity with writing a dataset, preprocessing, and training a model.

## How to set up

```pip3 install torch numpy nltk```

In main.py:
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('wordnet')

Can be run once and then deleted afterwards
